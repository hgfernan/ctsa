# Steps of the generation of tests

## Set limits in `paramlims` database

## Generate `parameters` database

## Generate `datafiles` database from `data/` folder

## Build C, Python, and R code, updating `codes` ddatabase

## Confirm needed packages are installed in the R environment

## Confirm needed packages are installed in the Python environment

## Start execution of C codes, passing `exec_id` by the command line

## Start execution of Python codes, passing `exec_id` by the command line

## Start execution of R codes, passing `exec_id` by the command line

## Collection of execution data to update `execs` database

## Comparison of test results and generation of `tests` database
